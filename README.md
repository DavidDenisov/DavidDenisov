- 👋 Hi, I’m David Denisov; currently an M.S. student.
- 👀 I’m currently mostly interested at [coresets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09384), and their significant applications for many problems, e.g., (from my current active projects) ML, DL, Robotics and even cyber security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in Prof. Dan Feldamn's Lab and am supervised by him; as mentioned above, I work on many projects and currently *learn from doing*, or in relation to the projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some interesting ideas that you might have.
- 📫 If you want to reach me simply send a message here and most likely I would be genuinely glad to hear.
